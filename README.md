# NaturalDisasterManagementSystem

This project simulates earthquakes and visualizes their impact on a city's infrastructure through a graph-based system. It combines real-time graphical rendering with powerful graph algorithms and modular code architecture.

---

## Overview

The system models a city using vertices (e.g., cities, hospitals) and edges (roads), supports earthquake simulation, and provides visual and terminal feedback through a user-friendly graphical interface.

It is designed to be **highly modularized**, with functions written to be **flexible and above all easily reusable**.

### üñºÔ∏è Function Naming Conventions

- `draw*` ‚Üí Graphical rendering functions (also handle light computation)
- `display*` ‚Üí Terminal-based visualization for debugging and inspection

---

## üñ±Ô∏è User Interaction & Display Logic

Raylib only allows **one main window**, so multiple modes (pseudo-windows) are handled using:

```c
typedef enum {
    MODE_GRAPH,
    MODE_VERTEX_DETAILS,
    MODE_ROAD_DETAILS
} AppMode;
```

- **Right-click on a vertex** ‚Üí View road info
- **Left-click on a road** ‚Üí View vertex info

> If the state **"State: (4 ‚Üí 2)" appears in orange**, it indicates that the road's state changed from **4 to 2** as a result of the earthquake.

---

### üîß Customizing the Graph Input

Inside **`graph.h`**, which serves as the main header file (used by `general.c` and others), you can easily switch the graph data source by modifying the following lines (typically around lines 5‚Äì6):

```c
#define FILENAME_TXT "graphL1.txt"
#define FILENAME_JSON "graphL1.json"
```

Change these filenames to use a different graph file from the **Graph\_json/** or **MatAdj\_txt/** directories.

### üîò UI Buttons (Top-left corner, 3 dots)

If the **H icon is green**, it means the corresponding option is currently **enabled and visible** in the interface.


| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Earthquake** | Randomly affects a city quadrant (NE, NW, SE, SW). Affects road status (orange = damaged). Can be triggered multiple times. |
| **State's Roads** | Toggle ON/OFF the visibility of damaged roads. |
| **Intervention** | Sends help from the closest hospital/warehouse to affected nodes. |
| **Group Accessible Areas** | Highlights strongly connected areas in the graph. |
| **Minimal Spanning Tree** | Displays the MST of the graph. |

Certainly! Here's a revised and polished version of that section in clear, correct English, ready to be added to the README:

### üñºÔ∏è A Few Examples (with Graph Visualizations)

Below are a few visual examples using **`graphe3.json`**, the small 6-vertex test graph:

**State's Roads "ON" after two earthquakes**
You can see the affected roads highlighted in **orange**, indicating damaged connections following the simulated earthquakes.

**Group Accessible Areas "ON"**
This mode highlights **strongly connected components** of the graph, helping to visualize clusters that remain internally accessible.

**Minimal Spanning Tree "ON"**
This view displays the **Minimal Spanning Tree (MST)** of the current graph, showing a subset of edges that connects all vertices with the minimum total weight.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Earthquake Simulation Tips

- Multiple earthquakes can be triggered to **increase intervention opportunities**.
- If **no intervention occurs**, it is **not necessarily a bug**‚Äîthe damaged node might be **unreachable** via Dijkstra's algorithm.
- Most nodes should remain accessible.

## üß∞  Building & Running the Project

### Prerequisites

- `gcc`
- `raylib` (you may need to **update the include path** in your `CFLAGS` accordingly. Normally it's adaptive but in case.)

### Compilation (example)

From `dynamic_interface/`, run:

```bash
make
```

```bash
./graph
```

To clean and rebuild:

```bash
make clean
make
```
